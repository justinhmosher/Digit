      and shares information about you when you use our website, web app, and related services (collectively, the
      “Service”). It also describes your choices about your information.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect information in three main ways: (a) information you provide to us, (b) information we collect automatically, and (c) information from third parties.</p>

    <h3>(a) Information You Provide</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account or use the Service, we may collect your
        name, email address, phone number, password, and related profile details.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Payment &amp; Transaction Information:</strong> When you pay a restaurant through Dyne, we collect
        transaction details such as the restaurant, items ordered, subtotal, taxes, tips, discounts, and total
        amount. Payment card data is processed by our third-party payment processors; we do not store full card
        numbers on our servers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Reviews &amp; Feedback:</strong> If you leave ratings, reviews, comments, or other feedback about a
        restaurant or your experience, we collect the content you submit.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Customer Support:</strong> If you contact us, we may collect the information you provide in your
        request (such as your name, email, phone number, and the content of your message).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>(b) Information We Collect Automatically</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect information about how you access and use the Service, such as pages
        viewed, features used, time and date of access, and referring/exit pages.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Device &amp; Log Data:</strong> We may collect information about the device and browser you use,
        including IP address, browser type, operating system, device identifiers, and diagnostic logs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Location Data:</strong> We may collect approximate location information derived from your IP address
        and, where you choose to allow it, more precise location from your device (for example, via your browser’s
        location permissions).
        We use this information to:
        <ul>
          <li>Show and recommend nearby restaurants that use Dyne, and</li>
          <li>Help detect and prevent fraud and suspicious activity.</li>
        </ul>
        You can disable precise location sharing in your device or browser settings, but some features (like
        location-based recommendations) may not work as intended.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cookies &amp; Similar Technologies:</strong> We may use cookies, pixels, and similar technologies to
        remember your preferences, keep you signed in, and understand how you interact with the Service.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>(c) Information from Third Parties</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Payment Processors:</strong> We receive limited information from payment processors (such as payment
        status, last 4 digits of a card, and transaction identifiers) to confirm payments and handle disputes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Restaurants &amp; POS Systems:</strong> We may receive ticket/receipt information and related order
        data from participating restaurants and their point-of-sale (POS) systems so we can display live receipts and
        process payments.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>SMS Providers (Twilio):</strong> When we send or receive SMS messages through our SMS service
        provider (such as Twilio), we may receive information about message delivery, timestamps, and other technical
        metadata.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. SMS, Phone Numbers &amp; Twilio</h2>
    <p>
      Dyne uses SMS as a core part of authentication and transactional communication. We work with third-party SMS
      providers such as <strong>Twilio</strong> to deliver these messages.
    </p>
    <p>We may collect and process the following in connection with SMS:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your phone number</li>
      <li>One-time passcodes (OTP) and verification codes</li>
      <li>Message content related to authentication and transactions</li>
      <li>Technical metadata, such as timestamps, delivery status, and carrier information</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We use SMS and Twilio to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Send one-time passcodes (OTP) for account verification and sign-in</li>
      <li>Confirm transactional actions, such as payment confirmations or security alerts</li>
      <li>Help protect your account and reduce fraud</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>We do not use SMS for marketing or promotional messages.</strong></p>

    <p>
      By providing your phone number, you consent to our use of Twilio or similar providers to send you these
      messages. Message and data rates may apply. You can opt out of SMS by replying <strong>STOP</strong> as
      described in our Terms, but doing so may prevent you from using core features that require phone verification.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Provide and Operate the Service:</strong> To create and manage accounts, display live receipts, process payments and tips, and enable diners to pay restaurants through Dyne.</li>
      <li><strong>Authentication &amp; Security:</strong> To verify your identity, send SMS one-time passcodes, protect against fraud, and secure the Service.</li>
      <li><strong>Restaurant Recommendations &amp; Discovery:</strong> To show and recommend nearby or relevant restaurants, including using your approximate or precise location where permitted.</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics &amp; Insights:</strong> To understand how diners and restaurants use Dyne, to provide restaurants with aggregated insights (such as repeat visits or menu item performance), and to improve our features.</li>
      <li><strong>Communication:</strong> To respond to your inquiries, send you important notices about your account or transactions, and provide updates about changes to our terms or policies.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal &amp; Compliance:</strong> To comply with legal obligations, enforce our Terms and Conditions, and protect our rights, privacy, safety, and property, and that of our users and partners.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. How We Share Information</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share information in the following ways:</p>

    <h3>(a) Service Providers</h3>
    <p>
      We share information with third-party vendors and service providers that help us operate the Service, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Payment processors</li>
      <li>SMS providers (e.g., Twilio)</li>
      <li>Hosting and infrastructure providers</li>
      <li>Analytics and monitoring tools</li>
      <li>Customer support tools</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These providers are authorized to use your information only as necessary to provide services to us and are
      contractually obligated to protect your information.
    </p>

    <h3>(b) Restaurants &amp; Restaurant Partners</h3>
    <p>
      When you dine at a participating restaurant and use Dyne, we may share relevant information with that restaurant,
      such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Details of your visit and order</li>
      <li>Payment and tip amounts</li>
      <li>High-level information about your repeat visits or feedback</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We generally provide restaurants with aggregated and/or de-identified insights, but some transaction-specific
      information is necessarily associated with your visit so they can reconcile payments.
    </p>

    <h3>(c) Legal, Safety, and Compliance</h3>
    <p>We may disclose information if we believe it is reasonably necessary to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request</li>
      <li>Enforce our Terms and other agreements</li>
      <li>Protect the security or integrity of the Service</li>
      <li>Protect the rights, property, or safety of Dyne, our users, restaurants, or the public</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>(d) Business Transfers</h3>
    <p>
      If Dyne is involved in a merger, acquisition, financing, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your
      information may be transferred as part of that transaction, in which case we will take reasonable steps to
      require the recipient to honor this Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
    <p>
      We may use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to provide, personalize, and improve the Service,
      including to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Keep you signed in</li>
      <li>Remember your preferences</li>
      <li>Measure and analyze usage</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can typically set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you disable
      cookies, some features of Dyne may not function properly.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain your information for as long as necessary to provide the Service, comply with our legal obligations,
      resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
    </p>
    <p>
      The specific retention period may vary depending on the type of data, the purpose for which it is used, and our
      legal obligations (for example, financial and transaction records may be retained for longer periods as required
      by law or for accounting purposes).
    </p>

    <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect your information
      against unauthorized access, loss, misuse, or alteration. However, no method of transmission over the internet
      or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Your Choices &amp; Rights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Account Information:</strong> You can update certain account information (such as your email or phone
        number) by logging into your account.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Location Data:</strong> You can control whether we receive precise location data through your device
        or browser settings. Disabling location may limit certain features, such as nearby restaurant recommendations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>SMS:</strong> You may opt out of SMS by replying <strong>STOP</strong> to our messages. However, this
        may prevent you from using core features that require SMS-based verification.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Marketing Emails (if any):</strong> If we send non-transactional emails in the future, you will be
        able to unsubscribe by following the instructions in those emails.
      </li>
    </ul>
