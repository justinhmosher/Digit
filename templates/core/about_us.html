            What we do
          </h2>
          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
            Dyne connects restaurants and guests through a simple, browser-based
            checkout. No app download. No waiting for a check. Just tap, pay,
            and go.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-400 leading-relaxed">
            Behind the scenes, Dyne quietly captures the signals that matter:
            which dishes guests crave, which experiences feel special, and which
            visits turn into regulars.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-400 leading-relaxed">
            The result is a smoother night for staff, a better experience for
            guests, and a smarter playbook for owners.

            Dyne is built for operators who care about hospitality and growth.
            We remove friction at checkout and give you clarity on what’s
            working in the room.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-400 leading-relaxed">
            Understand which dishes keep guests coming back, how different
            shifts perform, and what your customers are saying so you can refine what matters most.
            Use Dyne to improve service, coach staff, and design experiences
            that feel intentionally crafted.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-400 leading-relaxed">
            All of this happens without changing your core service style—
            Dyne plugs in quietly and lets your team do what they do best.

          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
            Guests get the experience they already want: arrive, enjoy,

          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-400 leading-relaxed">
            Dyne lets people review their live receipt, tip confidently,
            and walk out when they’re ready. Their loyalty is tied to
            the restaurants they love, not another app on their phone.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-400 leading-relaxed">
            And when guests share feedback, it goes straight to the teams
            that can act on it—helping elevate each return visit.

          How Dyne works for your guests
        </h2>
        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
          From the guest’s perspective, Dyne is simple. There’s no app to download
          and nothing new for them to learn—just a smoother way to pay and leave
          when they’re ready.
        </p>

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-slate-100">Share their member number</h3>
            <p class="text-slate-400 leading-relaxed">
              At the start of the meal, the guest gives their Dyne member number
              to the server. You ring in the check as normal—Dyne simply links
              that ticket to their profile.
            </p>

            <p class="text-slate-400 leading-relaxed">
              As items are added, the guest can pull up a live receipt on their
              phone—seeing every course, modifier, and tax line in real time.
              No surprises at the end of the night.

            <p class="text-slate-400 leading-relaxed">
              When they’re ready, guests pay directly from their phone using a
              secure, Stripe-powered checkout. They choose their tip, confirm,
              and the check is closed—no handing over cards or waiting for
              signatures.
            </p>

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-slate-100">Leave at their convenience</h3>
            <p class="text-slate-400 leading-relaxed">
              Once payment is complete, guests are free to leave when it feels
              natural to them. They can optionally leave quick feedback on their
              experience, giving you signal on what brings them back.

          For your team, this means fewer trips to the terminal and less time
          chasing checks, thereby creating quicker table turnover and more revenue—
          while Dyne quietly captures the data behind each visit.
